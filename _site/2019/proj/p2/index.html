## 1. Deadline <br />
<strong>11:59PM, Sunday, March 17, 2019.</strong></p>

<p><a name="intro"></a><br />
## 2. Introduction<br />
The aim of this project is to implement an end-to-end pipeline to swap faces in a<br />
video just like <a href="https://www.snapchat.com/">Snapchat’s face swap filter</a> or <a href="http://faceswaplive.com/">this face swap website</a>. It’s a fairly complicated procedure and variants of the approach you’ll implement have<br />
been used in many movies.</p>

<p>One of the most popular example of using such a method<br />
is replacing Paul Walker’s brother’s face by Paul Walker’s face in the Fast and Furious 7 movie<br />
after his sudden death in a car crash during shooting. Now that I have conviced you that this is not just for fun but is useful too. In the next few sections, let us see how this can be done.</p>

<p>Note that, you’ll need to be aware of ethical issues while replacing faces. Similar methods are used by people for the creation of fake videos of celibrities called Deep Fakes.</p>

<p><a name="data"></a><br />
## 3. Data Collection<br />
Record two videos. One of yourself with just your face and the other with<br />
your face and your friend’s face in all the frames. Convert them to <code class="highlighter-rouge">.avi</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">.mp4</code> format.<br />
Save them to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Data</code> folder. Feel free to play around with more videos. In the first video,<br />
we’ll replace your face with some celebrity’s face or your favorite relative’s face. In the<br />
second video we’ll swap the two faces. If there are more than two faces in the video, swap<br />
the two largest faces.</p>

<p><a name="landmarks"></a><br />
### 4.1. Facial Landmarks detection<br />
The first step in the traditional approach is to find facial landmarks (important points on the face) so that we have one-to-one correspondence between the facial landmakrs. This is analogous to the detection of corners in the panorama project. One of the major reasons to use facial landmarks instead of using all the points on the face is to reduce computational complexity. Remember that better results can be obtained using all the points (dense flow) or using a meshgrid. For detecting facial landmarks we’ll use <code class="highlighter-rouge">dlib</code> library built into OpenCV and python. A sample output of Dlib is shown below.</p>

<p><a name="tri"></a><br />
### 4.2. Face Warping using Triangulation<br />
Like we discussed before, we have now obtained facial landmarks, but what do we do with them? We need to ideally warp the faces in 3D, however we don’t have 3D information. Hence can we make some assumption about the 2D image to approximate 3D information of the face. One simple way is to triangulate using the facial landmarks as corners and then make the assumption that in each triangle the content is planar (forms a plane in 3D) and hence the warping between the the triangles in two images is affine. Triangulating or forming a triangular mesh over the 2D image is simple but we want to trinagulate such that it’s fast and has an “efficient” triangulation. One such method is obtained by drawing the dual of the Voronoi diagram, i.e., connecting each two neighboring sites in the Voronoi diagram. This is called the <strong>Delaunay Triangulation</strong> and can be constructed in \(\mathcal{O}(n\log{}n)\) time. We want the triangulation to be consistent with the image boundary such that texture regions won’t fade into the background while warping. <i>Delaunay Triangulation tries the maximize the smallest angle in each triangle</i>.</p>

<div class="fig fighighlight">

  <div class="figcaption">
    Fig 5: Comparison of good and bad triangulation depending on choice of landmarks. 
  </div>
</div>

<p>Since, Delaunay Triangulation tries the maximize the smallest angle in each triangle, we will obtain the same triangulation in both the images, i.e., cat and baby’s face. Hence, if we have correspondences between the facial landmarks we also have correspondences between the triangles (this is awesome! and makes life simple). Because we are using <code class="highlighter-rouge">dlib</code> to obtain the facial landmarks (or click points manually if you want to warp a cat to a kid), we have correspondences between facial landmarks and hence correspondences between the triangles, i.e., we have the same mesh in both images. Use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">getTriangleList()</code> function in <code class="highlighter-rouge">cv2.Subdiv2D</code> class of OpenCV to implement Delaunay Triangulation. Refer to <a href="https://www.learnopencv.com/delaunay-triangulation-and-voronoi-diagram-using-opencv-c-python/">this tutorial</a> for an easy start. Now, we need to warp the destination face to the source face (we are using inverse warping so that we don’t have any holes in the image, <a href="https://www.cs.unc.edu/~lazebnik/research/fall08/lec08_faces.pdf">read up why inverse warping is better than forward warping</a>) or to a mean face (obtained by averaging the triangulations (corners of triangles) of two faces). Implement the following steps to warp one face (<script type="math/tex">\mathcal{A}</script> or source) to another (<script type="math/tex">\mathcal{B}</script> or destination).</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> For each triangle in the target/destination face <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{B}</script>, compute the Barycentric coordinate.</li>
</ul>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{bmatrix}
 \mathcal{B}_{a,x} & \mathcal{B}_{b,x} & \mathcal{B}_{c,x}\\
 \mathcal{B}_{a,y} & \mathcal{B}_{b,y} & \mathcal{B}_{c,y}\\
 1 & 1 & 1\\
 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \alpha \\ \beta \\ \gamma \\ \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ 1\\ \end{bmatrix} %]]></script>

<p>Here, the Barycentric coordinate is given by <script type="math/tex">% <![CDATA[
\begin{bmatrix} \alpha & \beta & \gamma \end{bmatrix}^T %]]></script>. Note that, the matrix on the left hand size and it’s inverse need to be computed only once per triangle. In this matrix, <script type="math/tex">a, b, c</script> represent the corners of the triangle and <script type="math/tex">x,y</script> represent the <script type="math/tex">x</script> and <script type="math/tex">y</script> coordinates of the particular triangle corner respectively.</p>

<p>Now, given the values of the matrix on the left hand size we will call <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{B}_{\Delta}</script> and the value of <script type="math/tex">% <![CDATA[
\begin{bmatrix} x & y & 1 \end{bmatrix}^T %]]></script> we can compute the value of <script type="math/tex">% <![CDATA[
\begin{bmatrix} \alpha & \beta & \gamma \end{bmatrix}^T %]]></script> as follows:</p>

<p><script type="math/tex">\begin{bmatrix} \alpha \\ \beta \\ \gamma \\ \end{bmatrix} = \mathcal{B}_{\Delta}^{-1} \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ 1\\ \end{bmatrix}</script><br />
Now, given the values of <script type="math/tex">\alpha, \beta, \gamma</script> we can say that a point <script type="math/tex">x</script> lies inside the triangle if <script type="math/tex">\alpha \in [0, 1]</script>, <script type="math/tex">\beta \in [0, 1]</script> and <script type="math/tex">\alpha + \beta + \gamma \in [0,1]</script>. <strong>DO NOT USE any built-in function for this part</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Compute the corresponding pixel position in the source image <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{A}</script> using the barycentric equation shown in the last step but with a different triangle coordinates. This is computed as follows:</li>
</ul>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{bmatrix} x_{\mathcal{A}} \\ y_{\mathcal{A}} \\ z_{\mathcal{A}} \\ \end{bmatrix} = \mathcal{A}_{\Delta} \begin{bmatrix} \alpha \\ \beta \\ \gamma\\ \end{bmatrix}</script>

<p>Here, <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{A}_{\Delta}</script> is given as follows:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\mathcal{A}_{\Delta} = \begin{bmatrix}
 \mathcal{A}_{a,x} & \mathcal{A}_{b,x} & \mathcal{A}_{c,x}\\
 \mathcal{A}_{a,y} & \mathcal{A}_{b,y} & \mathcal{A}_{c,y}\\
 1 & 1 & 1\\
 \end{bmatrix} %]]></script>

<p>Note that, after we obtain  <script type="math/tex">% <![CDATA[
\begin{bmatrix} x_{\mathcal{A}} & y_{\mathcal{A}} & z_{\mathcal{A}} \end{bmatrix}^T %]]></script>, we need to convert the values to homogeneous coordinates as follows:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">x_{\mathcal{A}} = \frac{x_{\mathcal{A}}}{z_{\mathcal{A}}} \text{ and } y_{\mathcal{A}} = \frac{y_{\mathcal{A}}}{z_{\mathcal{A}}}</script>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now, copy back the value of the pixel at <script type="math/tex">(x_{\mathcal{A}}, y_{\mathcal{A}} )</script> to the target location. Use <code class="highlighter-rouge">scipy.interpolate.interp2d</code> to perform this operation.</li>
</ul>

### 4.3. Face Warping using Thin Plate Spline<br />
As we discussed before, triangulation assumes that we are doing affine transformation on each triangle. This might not be the best way to do warping since the human face has a very complex and smooth shape. A better way to do the transformation is by using Thin Plate Splines (TPS) which can model arbitrarily complex shapes. Now, we want to compute a TPS that maps from the feature points in <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{B}</script> to the corresponding feature<br />
points in <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{A}</script> . Note that we need two splines, one for the <script type="math/tex">x</script> coordinate and one for the <script type="math/tex">y</script>. Imagine a TPS to mathematically model beating a metal plate with a hammer. A thin<br />
plate spline has the following form:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">f(x,y) = a_1 + (a_x)x + (a_y)y + \sum_{i=1}^p{w_i U\left( \vert \vert (x_i,y_i) - (x,y)\vert \vert_1\right)}</script>

<p>Here, <script type="math/tex">U(r) = r^2\log (r^2 )</script>.</p>

<p>Note that, again in this case we are performing inverse warping, i.e., finding parameters of a Thin Plate Spline which will map from <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{B}</script> to <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{A}</script>. Warping using a TPS is performed in two steps. Let’s look at the steps below.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> In the first step, we will estimate the parameters of the TPS. The solution of the TPS model requires solving the following equation:</li>
</ul>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{bmatrix} K & P\\ P^T & 0\\ \end{bmatrix} 
  \begin{bmatrix} w_1 \\ w_2 \\ \vdots \\ w_p \\ a_x \\ a_y \\ a_1  \end{bmatrix}  =
  \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ \vdots \\ v_p \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} %]]></script>

<p>where \( K_{ij} = U\left( \vert \vert (x_i,y_i)-(x_j,y_j) \vert \vert_1 \right)\). <script type="math/tex">v_i = f(x_i,y_i)</script> and the i<sup>th</sup> row of <script type="math/tex">P</script> is <script type="math/tex">(x_i, y_i, 1)</script>. <script type="math/tex">K</script> is a matrix of size size <script type="math/tex">p \times p</script>, and <script type="math/tex">P</script> is a matrix of size <script type="math/tex">p \times 3</script>. In order to have a stable solution you need to compute the solution by:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{bmatrix} w_1 \\ w_2 \\ \vdots \\ w_p \\ a_x \\ a_y \\ a_1  \end{bmatrix}  = 
  \left(\begin{bmatrix} K & P\\ P^T & 0\\ \end{bmatrix}  + \lambda I(p+3, p+3)\right)^{-1}
 \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ \vdots \\ v_p \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} %]]></script>

<p>where <script type="math/tex">I(p+3,p+3)</script> is a <script type="math/tex">p+3 \times p+3</script> identity matrix. <script type="math/tex">\lambda \ge 0</script> but is generally very close to zero. Think about why we need this. Note that you need to do this step twice, once for <script type="math/tex">x</script> co-ordinates and once for <script type="math/tex">y</script> co-ordinates.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> In the second step, use the estimated parameters of the TPS models (both <script type="math/tex">x</script> and <script type="math/tex">y</script> directions), transform all pixels in image <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{B}</script> by the TPS model. Now, read back the pixel value from image <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{A}</script> directly. The position of the pixels in image <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{A}</script> is generated by the TPS equation (first equation in this section).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note that, both warping methods solve the same problem but with different formulations, you are required to implement both and compare the results.</strong></p>

<p><a name="replace"></a><br />
### 4.4. Replace Face<br />
This part is very simple, you have to take all the pixels from face <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{A}</script>, warp them to fit face <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{B}</script> and replace the pixels. Note that simply replacing pixels will not look natural as the lighing and edges look different. A sample output of face replacement is shown below.</p>

<div class="fig fighighlight">
  <img src="/assets/2019/p2/FaceReplacement.png" width="70%" />
  <div class="figcaption">
    Fig 7: Output of sample face replacement. Notice the difference in color and edges. The output is not a seamless blend. 
  </div>
</div>

<p><a name="blending"></a><br />
### 4.5. Blending<br />
We will follow a method called Poisson Blending to blend the warped face onto the target face. More details about this method can be found in <a href="http://www.irisa.fr/vista/Papers/2003_siggraph_perez.pdf">this paper</a>. Note that, you <strong>DO NOT</strong> have to implement this part from scratch, feel free to use any open-source implementation and cite your source in your report and your code. Your task in this part is to blend the face as seamlessly as possible. Feel free to reuse concepts you learnt from panorama stitching project’s last part here. A good blending output is shown below.</p>

<div class="fig fighighlight">
  <img src="/assets/2019/p2/FaceSwap.png" width="70%" />
  <div class="figcaption">

  </div>
</div>

<p><a name="motfilt"></a><br />
### 4.6. Motion Filtering<br />
After you have detected, warped and blended the face your algorithm works really well for individual frames. But when you want to do this for a video, you’ll see flickering. Come up with your own solution to reduce the amount of flickering. You can use a low-pass filter or a fancy Kalman Filter to do this. <strong>Feel free to use any third party or built-in code to do this.</strong> If you use third party code, please do not forget to cite them. Look at this holy grail video of face replacement where Jimmy Fallon interviews his cousin.</p>

<p><a name="ph2"></a><br />
## 5. Phase 2: Deep Learning Approach<br />
For this phase, we’ll run an off-the-shelf model to obtain face fiducials using deep learning. We think that implementing this part is fairly trivial and is left as a fun exercise if you want some programming practice (you are not graded for the implementation of the network). We’ll use the code from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.07835">this paper</a>, which implements a supervised encoder-decoder model to obtain the full 3D mesh of the face. We recommend you to read the paper for more details. The code from the paper can be found <a href="https://github.com/YadiraF/PRNet">here</a>. Your task is to setup the code and run to obtain face fiducials/full 3D mesh. Use this output to perform face replacement as before. Feel free to use as much code as you want from last part/phase. Present a detailed comparison of both the traditional methods (triangulation and TPS) along with the deep learning method.</p>

<p><a name="testset"></a><br />
## 6. Notes about Test Set<br />
One day (24 hours) before the deadline, a test set will be released with details of what faces to replace. We’ll grade on the completion of the project and visually appealing results.</p>

## 8. Debugging Tips<br />
- Plot the triangles with different colors as shown <a href="https://www.learnopencv.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/opencv-delaunay-vornoi-subdiv-example.jpg">here</a><br />
- Plot the face fiducials to check if they match up with color coding the points<br />
- View the warped images<br />
- Plotting and indexing functions could be using [row, column] indexing which is different from [x,y] indexing. They are swapped such that x denotes column and y denoted row. Be sure to check documentation to see which function uses what.<br />
- OpenCV documentation often has a lot of bugs with regard to indexing. Be sure to implement simple sanity checks.</p>
