<p><a name="intro"></a></p>

<h2 id="introduction">2. Introduction</h2>

<p>We have dealt with reconstructing 3D structure of a given scene using images from multiple views using the traditional (geometric) approach. Though, there is a possibility of achieving more robust results. In this project, we will learn about estimating depth and pose (or ego-motion) from a sequence of images using unsupervised learning methods. In <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~tinghuiz/projects/SfMLearner/cvpr17_sfm_final.pdf">SfMLearner</a> paper by David Lowe’s team at Google, an unsupervised learning framework was presented for the task of monocular depth and camera motion estimation from unstructured video sequences.</p>

<p>Your task is to make <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~tinghuiz/projects/SfMLearner/cvpr17_sfm_final.pdf">SfMLearner</a> ‘better’! When we say better, it means that the error in depth and pose estimation must be less than that of SfMLearner’s paper on different empirical evaluation scales. Research papers like <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02276.pdf">GeoNet</a> might help you in improving the results. Although, research papers in this field are in abundance. Feel free to search through the internet.</p>

<p>You will be mainly graded on the analysis of your approach and ‘your original’ implementation to make the SfMLearner better! You are encouraged to <strong>change the architecture, loss function and augement the data</strong>. Along with the standard report, you will be submitting a presentation video of about 5-7 mins long, explaining your approach and the in-depth analysis of your methods and the results. More on submission details are mentioned below in <a href="#sub">section 5</a>.</p>

<p>Note: You don’t have to reimplement SfMLearner again! You will be not graded for that. Use the SfMLearner code on <a href="https://github.com/tinghuiz/SfMLearner">Github</a> by the original authors. Feel free to modify the SfMLearner code. <strong>You are not allowed to use any online code except SfMLearner that involves any kind of ‘deep learning’ (apart from your previous projects).</strong> Although, <strong>feel free to use ANY traditional computer vision open source program or toolbox.</strong> DO NOT forget to cite them. You are restricted to <script type="math/tex">\sim</script> 12K images provided in the dataset for training.<br />
<strong>NOTE:</strong> You have to retrain the SfMLearner on the 12K images (rather than getting numbers from the paper) to have a fair comparison with your method. More on the dataset is given in <a href="#dataset">section 4</a></p>

<h2 id="sfmlearner">3. SfMLearner</h2>

<p>One of the trivial ways to solve this problem is to learn rotation and translation from a sequence of data. Although, learning such parameters directly is a weakly constrained problem. Thus, methods like <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~tinghuiz/projects/SfMLearner/cvpr17_sfm_final.pdf">SfMLearner</a>, jointly train a single-view depth CNN and a camera pose estimation CNN from unlabeled video sequence. <b>Assumption: The scene is fairly rigid <i>i.e.</i> the scene appearance change across different frames is dominated by the camera motion.</b></p>

<p><b> You are required to read <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~tinghuiz/projects/SfMLearner/cvpr17_sfm_final.pdf">SfMLearner</a> paper to work on this project. </b></p>

<p><a name="dataset"></a></p>

<h2 id="notes-about-data">4. Notes about Data</h2>

<p>You are given a multiple sequences from the <a href="http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/raw_data.php">KITTI</a> dataset. You can download the training data (and validation) from <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A1BtjeZW5p7FQGovjd5sySYusOEZy8Vl/view?usp=sharing">here</a>. Also, you can download the testing dataset from here: <a href="">KITTI Testing set</a>.<br />
Training set is available now. Testing set will be online soon.</p>

<h3 id="note-about-the-sfmlearner-code">4.1 Note about the SfMLearner Code</h3>

<p>The code provided in their <a href="https://github.com/tinghuiz/SfMLearner">official Github repository</a> may not work out of the box. <br />
In case you have error, like “num_source is not defined”, please download the updated <code class="highlighter-rouge">train.py</code> file from <a href="assets/2019/p4/train.py">here</a> and replace it with in the original <code class="highlighter-rouge">train.py</code>. It is the same file with a few flags changed.</p>

<p>For the rest of the code, please follow their official github repo!</p>

<h2 id="submission-guidelines">5. Submission Guidelines</h2>

<p><b> If your submission does not comply with the following guidelines, you’ll be given ZERO credit </b></p>

<p><a name="files"></a></p>

<h3 id="file-tree-and-naming">5.1. File tree and naming</h3>

<p>Your submission on ELMS/Canvas must be a <code class="highlighter-rouge">zip</code> file, following the naming convention <code class="highlighter-rouge">YourDirectoryID_p4.zip</code>. If you email ID is <code class="highlighter-rouge">abc@umd.edu</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">abc@terpmail.umd.edu</code>, then your <code class="highlighter-rouge">DirectoryID</code> is <code class="highlighter-rouge">abc</code>. For our example, the submission file should be named <code class="highlighter-rouge">abc_p1.zip</code>. The file <strong>must have the following directory structure</strong> because we’ll be autograding assignments. You can have any helper functions in sub-folders as you wish, be sure to index them using relative paths and if you have command line arguments for your Wrapper codes, make sure to have default values too. Please provide detailed instructions on how to run your code in <code class="highlighter-rouge">README.md</code> file. Please <strong>DO NOT</strong> include data in your submission.</p>
