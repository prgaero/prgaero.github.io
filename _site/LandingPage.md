CMSC 733: Computer Processing of Pictorial Information

Welcome to CMSC733 Computer Processing of Pictorial Information AKA Traditional and Deep Learning approaches for Geometric Computer Vision class by <a href="http://legacydirs.umiacs.umd.edu/~yiannis/">Prof. Yiannis Aloimonos</a>. The course is redesigned by <a href="http://nitinjsanket.github.io">Nitin J. Sanket</a> and <a href="https://chahatdeep.github.io/">Chahat Deep Singh</a> (your friendly and awesome TA's), , don't hesitate to contact them on Piazza if you find errors. 

This is an advanced course on graduate computer vision and computational photography. This course will explore image formation, image features, image segmentation, image stitching, image recognition, motion estimation, 3D point clouds and will touch upon basics of augmented reality. This course is heavily redesigned this time to showcase how to model classical 3D geometry problems using Deep Learning. 

All the class announcements will be made through Piazza. Please use Piazza to contact TAs. Please do **NOT** contact the TA's or the Instructor via Email unless it's an emergency, and do **NOT** contact the TA's on any social media platform such as Facebook or WhatsApp (please respect their privacy) regarding course content. If you want to have a chat about our research, feel free to contact the TA's or Instructor on any platform. 


All the projects and homeworks are to be submitted using ELMS.

Pre-requisites
Programming proficiency in Python 2.7 is a hard pre-requisite. We assume that the students are proficient with basic Linear Algebra, calculus and machine learning to the level of an undergraduate class.

Course Structure

This is a hands-on course, centered around four projects. There are also three homeworks and an in-class midterm exam, to reinforce your understanding of underlying concepts. This is a qualifying course for Computer Science PhD students in the area Vision and Graphics. The grading breakdown is as follows:

- Project 1: 16%
- Project 2: 13%
- Project 3: 18%
- Project 4: 16%
- Midterm Exam: 25%
- Homework 0: 7.0%
- Homework 1: 5.0%


Assignments
All projects and homeworks MUST be done in groups of 2. However, we encourage you to discuss with your peers and not cheat. The Midterm exam is done be done ALONE and no discssion is allowed. For clarifications, post a private post on Piazza. For further details, read the "Collaboration Policy and Honor Code" below. 


Syllabus
Singular Value Decomposition, Linear Least Squares, Random Sample Consensus, Image Acquisition, Color Spaces, Gaussians, Color Segmentation, Expectation Maximization, Gaussian Mixture Model, Convolution, Filtering in images, Corner and Edge Detection, Projective Geometry, Camera Model, Feature Matching, Homography, Classifiers, Optical Flow, Fundamental and Essential Matrix, Epipolar Geometry, Perspective-n-points, Bundle Adjustment, Fiducial markers, Factor graphs, Pose Graph Optimization, Visual Odometry, Structure from Motion, RGB-D reconstruction, perceptron, backpropagation, convolutional neural networks, deep learning.


Software
We will use Python 2.7 as the programming platform throughout this course along with packages from OpenCV, numpy, scikit learn and matplotlib. 



Late Policy
This course moves quickly, and concepts tend to build on top of each other. Therefore it's very important to keep up with the material. To encourage this, late assignments are penalized for 25% per day after the due date. But life is unpredictable; we all need a break sometimes. So, we allow you four "late days", to spend on any assignment(s) except the final project and the midterm exam. You may submit an assignment late (after the due date) using a late day without any penalty. Think of a late day as pushing the deadline back by a day. So, to get full credit on a 2-days-late assignment, you'd need to use two late days. Late days can only be spent as full days (i.e., you can't use only half a late day for an assignment you submit 12 hrs late). If you are using a late day, mention it in the title of your submission as "USING X LATE DAY(S)" and post a comment on ELMS about the usage of a late day. We expect you to keep track of number of late days you have remaining and notify us of usage of one or more late days. We will default for penalty if we don't see the mention of late day usage as a comment on ELMS on that particular assignment. 



Collaboration Policy and Honor Code
Collaboration is encouraged, but one should know the difference between collaboration and cheating. Cheating is prohibited and will carry serious consequences. Cheating may be defined as using or attempting to use unauthorized assistance, material, or study aids in academic work or examinations. Some examples of cheating are: collaborating on an in-class exam or homework unless explicitly allowed; copying homework; handing in someone else's work as your own; and plagiarism. You are welcome to collaborate with your peers on Piazza and in person. However it's important that the work you submit is an expression of your understanding, and not merely something you copied from a peer. So, we place strict limits on collaboration:

Firstly, you must clearly cite your collaborators by name at the top of your report. This includes Piazza posts referenced.
You may not share or copy each other's code. You can discuss how your code works, and the concepts it implements, but you can't just show someone your code.

You may use free and publicly available sources, such as books, journal and conference publications, and web pages, as research material for your answers. (You will not lose points for using external sources.) You may not use any service that involves payment, and you must clearly and explicitly cite all outside sources and materials that you made use of. We consider the use of uncited external sources as portraying someone else's work as your own, and as such it is a violation of the University's policies on academic dishonesty. Instances will be dealt with harshly and typically result in a failing course grade. Unless otherwise specified, you should assume that that the UMD Code of Academic Integrity applies.
