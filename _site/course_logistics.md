Professor Aloimonos - (By appointment)

TA Office hours are held in the 4th floor TA rooms in AV Williams.

## Course Objectives

This is an introductory course on computer vision and computational photography. This course will explore image formation, image features, image segmentation, image stitching, image recognition, motion estimation, and 3D point cloud processing. 

## Pre-requisites
Programming proficiency is the only hard pre-requisite.  We recommend familiarity with Matlab and
basic Linear Algebra.

## Software and Reference

## Software
We will use Matlab and the Matlab Computer Toolbox in this course.  Both are available to UMD students
through <a href="https://terpware.umd.edu/">Terpware</a>.

### Reference Books
All concepts will be covered in lecture, and in the course lecture notes.  However, we also
recommend the following books as good references:

## Course Structure

This is a hands-on course, centered around four projects.  There are also three homeworks and an
in-class midterm exam, to reinforce your understanding of 
underlying concepts.

The grading breakdown is as follows:

Project 1: 12.5%
Project 2: 12.5%
Project 3: 15%
Project 4: 20%

Homework 1: 5%
Homework 2: 5%
Homework 3: 5%

Midterm Exam: 15%
Class Participation - Lecture: 5%
Class Participation - Piazza:  5%

### Assignments  
All projects are intended to be done in groups of three.  Homeworks, however, must be done
individually (though you may collaborate with your peers as per "Collaboration Policy and Honor
Code" below). 

### Class Participation
The class participation grade is based on participation in lecture and in the course piazza.  To get
a good participation grade, attend and be active in lectures, and be active (asking useful questions
and/or providing useful answers) on the class Piazza.

## Late Policy
This course moves quickly, and concepts tend to build on top of each other.  Therefore it's very important to keep up with the material.  To encourage this, late assignments are docked 20% for the first day, and 10% per day after that.

But life is unpredictable; we all need a break sometimes.  So, we allow you <b>four "late days"</b>, to spend on any assignment(s) except the final project.  You may submit an assignment late (after the due date) using a late day without any penalty.  Think of a late day as pushing the deadline back by a day.  So, to get full credit on a 2-days-late assignment, you'd need to use two late days.  Late days can only be spent as full days (i.e., you can't use only half a late day for an assignment you submit 12 hrs late).

If you are using a late day, mention it in the title of your submission as ``USING <number> OF LATE DAY(S)''. 

## Academic Accomodations

Any student eligible for and requesting academic accommodations due to a disability is requested to provide, to the instructor in office hours, a letter of accommodation from the Office of Accessibility and Disability Services (ADS) within the first TWO weeks of the semester. 

## Collaboration Policy and Honor Code

Collaboration is encouraged, but one should know the difference between collaboration and cheating. Cheating is prohibited and will carry serious consequences. Cheating may be defined as using or attempting to use unauthorized assistance, material, or study aids in academic work or examinations. Some examples of cheating are: collaborating on a take-home exam or homework unless explicitly allowed; copying homework; handing in someone else's work as your own; and plagiarism. 

You are welcome to collaborate with your peers on Piazza and in person. However it's important that the work you submit is an expression of *your* understanding, and not merely something you copied from a peer.  So, we place strict limits on collaboration:
- Firstly, you must clearly cite your collaborators by name at the top of your report.  This includes Piazza posts referenced.
- You may not share or copy each other's code.  You can discuss how your code works, and the concepts it implements, but you can't just show someone your code.
- For homeworks, when it comes to formulating or writing solutions, you must work alone.  For example, if you're working with your peers on a common whiteboard, you may not simply copy from that whiteboard; you must write your answer separately, based on your own understanding of what you discussed.   

You may use free and publicly available sources, such as books, journal and conference publications, and web pages, as research material for your answers. (You will not lose points for using external sources.)

You may not use any service that involves payment, and you must clearly and explicitly cite all outside sources and materials that you made use of. We consider the use of uncited external sources as portraying someone else's work as your own, and as such it is a violation of the University's policies on academic dishonesty. Instances will be dealt with harshly and typically result in a failing course grade.

Unless otherwise specified, you should assume that that the <a href="http://www.president.umd.edu/policies/iii100a.html">UMD Code of Academic Integrity applies</a>.
